      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only celestial body known to support life. It is a dynamic world with oceans, continents, weather systems, and a biosphere teeming with biodiversity. Earth rotates on its axis every 24 hours and orbits the Sun every 365.25 days.
      </p>

      <h2>Quick Facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Orbital Distance:</strong> ~149.6 million km (1 AU)</li>
        <li><strong>Orbital Period (Year):</strong> 365.25 days</li>
        <li><strong>Rotation Period (Day):</strong> 23.93 hours</li>
        <li><strong>Equatorial Diameter:</strong> 12,742 km</li>
        <li><strong>Mass:</strong> 5.97 √ó 10¬≤‚Å¥ kg</li>
        <li><strong>Surface Gravity:</strong> 9.8 m/s¬≤</li>
        <li><strong>Average Temperature:</strong> ~15¬∞C</li>
        <li><strong>Natural Satellites:</strong> 1 (The Moon)</li>
        <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> 78% Nitrogen, 21% Oxygen, 1% Other Gases</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Internal Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Earth consists of four major layers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Crust:</strong> The solid outer layer, divided into tectonic plates.</li>
        <li><strong>Mantle:</strong> A thick, viscous layer responsible for convection currents driving plate movements.</li>
        <li><strong>Outer Core:</strong> A liquid iron and nickel layer that generates Earth‚Äôs magnetic field.</li>
        <li><strong>Inner Core:</strong> A solid metallic core with temperatures reaching up to 5,700¬∞C.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Atmosphere & Climate</h2>
      <p>
        Earth‚Äôs atmosphere plays a vital role in supporting life. The greenhouse effect maintains a stable temperature, while the ozone layer protects against harmful UV radiation. Weather systems are driven by solar energy and ocean currents, creating a variety of climates across continents.
      </p>

      <h2>Hydrosphere</h2>
      <p>
        71% of Earth‚Äôs surface is covered by water. The oceans regulate global temperature, host marine ecosystems, and drive weather patterns. Freshwater systems, including rivers, lakes, and glaciers, are crucial for life on land.
      </p>

      <h2>Biosphere & Life</h2>
      <p>
        Earth hosts an incredible variety of life forms. From microscopic bacteria to complex organisms, ecosystems are found in nearly every environment‚Äîfrom deep ocean trenches to high mountain ranges. Life adapts to extreme conditions, a phenomenon known as extremophilia.
      </p>

      <h2>Moon</h2>
      <p>
        Earth‚Äôs only natural satellite, the <strong>Moon</strong>, is 3,474 km in diameter and orbits Earth at a distance of ~384,400 km. It stabilizes Earth‚Äôs axial tilt, affecting seasons and tides. The Moon has inspired mythology, calendars, and space exploration‚Äîmost notably the Apollo missions.
      </p>

      <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System.</li>
        <li>It experiences around 50,000 earthquakes a year‚Äîthough most are too small to be felt.</li>
        <li>Earth's magnetic field protects us from solar winds and cosmic radiation.</li>
        <li>More than 200 Earth-like exoplanets have been discovered, but none match its habitability.</li>
      </ul>
