            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p><strong>Venus</strong> is the second planet from the Sun and often called Earth's twin due to its similar size and structure. However, its surface conditions are vastly different and extremely hostile to life as we know it.</p>

            <h2>Quick Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Distance from Sun:</strong> 108.2 million km (67.2 million miles)</li>
                <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 12,104 km (7,521 miles)</li>
                <li><strong>Length of Day:</strong> 243 Earth days (retrograde rotation)</li>
                <li><strong>Length of Year:</strong> 225 Earth days</li>
                <li><strong>Average Surface Temp:</strong> 464°C (867°F)</li>
                <li><strong>Moons:</strong> None</li>
                <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> 96% carbon dioxide, thick sulfuric acid clouds</li>
                <li><strong>Surface Pressure:</strong> 92 times that of Earth</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Unique Characteristics</h2>
            <p>Venus rotates from east to west, opposite to most other planets. Its atmosphere traps heat through a powerful greenhouse effect, making it hotter than Mercury despite being farther from the Sun.</p>
            <p>The surface is dry and barren, marked with volcanic plains, huge mountains like Maxwell Montes, and vast lava flows.</p>

            <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>🌅 A day on Venus is longer than its year.</li>
                <li>🌀 The clouds reflect sunlight well, making Venus one of the brightest objects in the night sky.</li>
                <li>🌡️ Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the solar system.</li>
                <li>🌋 Scientists believe Venus may still have active volcanoes.</li>
                <li>🛰️ Several spacecraft have visited Venus, including NASA’s Magellan and ESA’s Venus Express.</li>
