      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter is the <strong>largest planet</strong> in our solar system ‚Äî so massive that it could fit all the other planets inside it! Known for its swirling clouds, colorful stripes, and massive storms like the Great Red Spot, Jupiter is a gas giant made primarily of hydrogen and helium.
      </p>

      <h2>Quick Facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Orbital Distance:</strong> ~778 million km (5.2 AU)</li>
        <li><strong>Orbital Period:</strong> 11.86 Earth years</li>
        <li><strong>Rotation Period:</strong> 9.9 hours (fastest in the solar system)</li>
        <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 139,820 km</li>
        <li><strong>Mass:</strong> 1.90 √ó 10¬≤‚Å∑ kg (318 times Earth's)</li>
        <li><strong>Gravity:</strong> 24.8 m/s¬≤</li>
        <li><strong>Average Temperature:</strong> -145¬∞C</li>
        <li><strong>Moons:</strong> 95 known moons (as of 2025)</li>
        <li><strong>Main Composition:</strong> Hydrogen and Helium</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Atmosphere & Weather</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter‚Äôs atmosphere is a chaotic mix of cloud bands and storms. The most iconic is the <strong>Great Red Spot</strong>, a giant, persistent anticyclonic storm larger than Earth that has raged for at least 350 years. Jupiter's atmosphere also features powerful lightning, auroras, and extremely fast jet streams.
      </p>

      <h2>Moons</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter‚Äôs moons are a mini solar system of their own. The four largest‚Äîknown as the <strong>Galilean moons</strong>‚Äîare especially fascinating:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Io:</strong> The most volcanically active body in the solar system.</li>
        <li><strong>Europa:</strong> Has a subsurface ocean that may harbor life beneath its icy crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Ganymede:</strong> The largest moon in the solar system, even bigger than Mercury.</li>
        <li><strong>Callisto:</strong> An ancient, heavily cratered moon with a possible underground ocean.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Structure & Composition</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter lacks a solid surface. Beneath its thick atmosphere lies a deep layer of metallic hydrogen that conducts electricity, creating Jupiter‚Äôs powerful magnetic field‚Äîthe strongest among planets. Scientists believe it may have a rocky core at its center.
      </p>

      <h2>Rings</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter has a faint ring system made of dust particles ejected by some of its small inner moons. While not as majestic as Saturn‚Äôs, these rings are a fascinating part of Jupiter's complex system.
      </p>

      <h2>Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter has been studied by spacecraft including <strong>Pioneer</strong>, <strong>Voyager</strong>, <strong>Galileo</strong>, and more recently, <strong>Juno</strong>, which is currently orbiting and exploring its deep atmosphere, gravity, and magnetic field. Future missions like <strong>ESA‚Äôs JUICE</strong> and NASA's <strong>Europa Clipper</strong> will further study Jupiter and its moons.
      </p>

      <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Jupiter spins so fast that it bulges at the equator and flattens at the poles.</li>
        <li>Its magnetic field is 14 times stronger than Earth's.</li>
        <li>Jupiter emits more heat than it receives from the Sun.</li>
        <li>If Jupiter had grown much larger, it could have become a star!</li>
