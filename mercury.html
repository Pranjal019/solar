    <p><strong>Mercury</strong> — the swift messenger of the gods — is the smallest planet in our Solar System and the one closest to the Sun. Though it may be tiny, this rocky world is bursting with surprises, from wild temperature swings to an ancient surface that tells a story 4.5 billion years in the making.</p>

    <h2>🪐 Quick Facts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 4,879 km (just 38% the size of Earth)</li>
      <li><strong>Day Length:</strong> 58.6 Earth days</li>
      <li><strong>Year Length:</strong> 88 Earth days</li>
      <li><strong>Gravity:</strong> 3.7 m/s² (38% of Earth’s gravity)</li>
      <li><strong>Distance from Sun:</strong> 57.91 million km (0.39 AU)</li>
      <li><strong>Moons:</strong> 🚫 None</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🌡️ Extreme Temperatures</h2>
    <p>Without a real atmosphere to hold in heat, Mercury experiences one of the most dramatic temperature ranges in the Solar System — from a scorching <strong>427°C</strong> during the day to a freezing <strong>-173°C</strong> at night.</p>

    <h2>🌌 Mysterious Surface</h2>
    <p>Mercury’s landscape is pockmarked with impact craters and vast plains. Its most iconic feature, the <strong>Caloris Basin</strong>, is a colossal impact site stretching 1,550 km wide. Towering cliffs called <em>lobate scarps</em> cut across the surface — evidence that the planet shrank as it cooled!</p>

    <h2>🧲 Surprising Magnetism</h2>
    <p>Despite its size, Mercury has a global magnetic field — a discovery that shocked scientists. Generated by a partially molten metallic core, this field is about 1% as strong as Earth’s but still capable of creating miniature auroras!</p>

    <h2>☁️ Thin Exosphere</h2>
    <p>Mercury has no thick atmosphere — only a fragile <strong>exosphere</strong> made of sodium, potassium, hydrogen, and oxygen. These particles are constantly blown away by solar wind and replenished by the Sun’s radiation and micrometeoroid impacts.</p>

    <h2>🚀 Missions to Mercury</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mariner 10</strong> (1974): First spacecraft to visit Mercury and reveal its cratered surface.</li>
      <li><strong>MESSENGER</strong> (2011–2015): Orbited Mercury and gave us the first global maps, discovered volcanic activity, and detected polar water ice!</li>
      <li><strong>BepiColombo</strong> (En route): A joint ESA–JAXA mission launched in 2018, set to orbit Mercury in 2025 with dual orbiters for deep exploration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔭 Fun Facts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>It takes <strong>176 Earth days</strong> for Mercury to complete one sunrise-to-sunrise “solar day.”</li>
      <li>Mercury's orbit is the most eccentric of all planets — sometimes it's <strong>46 million km</strong> from the Sun, other times almost <strong>70 million km</strong> away!</li>
      <li>Named after the Roman god of speed, Mercury zooms around the Sun at <strong>47.87 km/s</strong> — the fastest of all planets!</li>
    </ul>
