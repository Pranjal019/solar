      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Mars, often called the <strong>Red Planet</strong>, is the fourth planet from the Sun and a top candidate for future human exploration. Its reddish hue comes from iron oxide (rust) on its surface. Although cold and arid today, Mars once had flowing rivers and possibly life-supporting conditions.

      <h2>Quick Facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Orbital Distance:</strong> ~227.9 million km (1.52 AU)</li>
        <li><strong>Orbital Period:</strong> 687 Earth days</li>
        <li><strong>Rotation Period:</strong> 24.6 hours</li>
        <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 6,779 km</li>
        <li><strong>Mass:</strong> 6.42 × 10²³ kg</li>
        <li><strong>Gravity:</strong> 3.7 m/s² (about 38% of Earth’s)</li>
        <li><strong>Average Temperature:</strong> -63°C</li>
        <li><strong>Moons:</strong> 2 (Phobos and Deimos)</li>
        <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> 95% CO₂, 3% Nitrogen, 1.6% Argon</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Surface Features</h2>
      <p>
        Mars has a diverse and fascinating landscape:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Olympus Mons:</strong> The tallest volcano and mountain in the Solar System, standing 21.9 km high.</li>
        <li><strong>Valles Marineris:</strong> A canyon system over 4,000 km long and up to 7 km deep.</li>
        <li><strong>Polar Ice Caps:</strong> Made of water and carbon dioxide ice, changing with the seasons.</li>
        <li><strong>Dust Storms:</strong> Some of the largest in the solar system, occasionally covering the entire planet.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Moons</h2>
      <p>
        Mars has two small, irregularly shaped moons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phobos:</strong> Orbits Mars in just 7.6 hours and is gradually spiraling inward.</li>
        <li><strong>Deimos:</strong> Smaller and farther out, it has a smoother appearance due to surface regolith.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Water on Mars</h2>
      <p>
        Mars once had liquid water on its surface—evidenced by dry riverbeds, deltas, and minerals that only form in the presence of water. Today, water exists as ice beneath the surface and in the polar caps. There’s also evidence of briny water that may occasionally flow on the surface.
      </p>

      <h2>Habitability & Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        While current surface conditions are inhospitable, Mars is a major focus of astrobiology. Past missions (like Curiosity and Perseverance) have searched for signs of ancient life, studied the planet’s geology, and prepared for human missions. Upcoming missions aim to return Martian samples to Earth.

      <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A day on Mars is called a “sol” and is only 40 minutes longer than an Earth day.</li>
        <li>Mars experiences seasons due to its axial tilt of 25°—similar to Earth’s.</li>
        <li>Mars has the largest dust storms in the solar system, sometimes lasting for months.</li>
        <li>Evidence suggests Mars may have had a magnetic field in the past.</li>
      </ul>
