      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is best known for its stunning and iconic ring system. As a gas giant composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, Saturn's atmosphere is home to numerous storms, including the famous hexagonal storm at its north pole. Saturn is a magnificent world of contrast, with serene yellow and golden hues that make it one of the most beautiful objects in the night sky.

      </ul>

      <h2>Atmosphere & Weather</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn’s atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, and its appearance is marked by bright bands of clouds. These bands represent different wind currents in the atmosphere. Saturn also experiences intense storms, with wind speeds reaching up to 1,800 km/h. The most notable feature in Saturn's atmosphere is its North Polar Hexagon—a mysterious six-sided jet stream vortex that is unlike anything found on Earth.
      </p>

      <h2>Moons</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn’s moons are numerous and diverse, with a wide variety of features. Some of the most interesting moons include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Titan:</strong> The largest of Saturn’s moons, Titan has a thick atmosphere and is the only moon known to have stable liquid on its surface, primarily methane and ethane lakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Enceladus:</strong> Known for its icy geysers, Enceladus might have an underground ocean that could support life.</li>
        <li><strong>Rhea:</strong> Saturn’s second-largest moon, Rhea has an icy surface and a thin atmosphere made of oxygen and carbon dioxide.</li>
        <li><strong>Mimas:</strong> Often called the "Death Star moon" due to a giant crater resembling the Death Star from Star Wars.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rings</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn’s rings are the most complex and magnificent in the solar system. Made of billions of ice particles, dust, and rocky debris, the rings are divided into several main groups: A, B, C, and D rings, with the A and B rings being the most prominent. The rings are thought to be remnants of moons or comets that were torn apart by Saturn’s gravitational pull.
      </p>

      <h2>Structure & Composition</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn is mostly made of hydrogen and helium, similar to Jupiter. Beneath its thick cloud cover lies a layer of metallic hydrogen, which surrounds a rocky and icy core. Saturn’s density is lower than water, meaning it could theoretically float in a giant pool of water!
      </p>

      <h2>Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn has been explored by several spacecraft, most notably NASA’s <strong>Cassini-Huygens mission</strong>, which spent 13 years studying Saturn, its rings, and its moons. The Huygens probe even landed on Titan in 2005, sending back remarkable images of the moon’s surface and atmosphere. Cassini's groundbreaking discoveries have expanded our understanding of Saturn and its many moons.

      <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Saturn is often mistaken for being the largest planet in the solar system, but it is actually the second-largest after Jupiter.</li>
        <li>Saturn's rings are incredibly thin, only about 1 km thick in some places!</li>
        <li>One of Saturn's moons, Titan, has lakes and seas made of liquid methane and ethane, not water.</li>
        <li>Saturn has more moons than any other planet, with over 80 discovered so far!</li>
      </ul>
