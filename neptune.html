      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, located more than 4.5 billion kilometers away from Earth. It is one of the two ice giants in our Solar System, alongside Uranus, and is known for its striking blue color, which is due to methane in its atmosphere. Discovered in 1846, Neptune is the last planet visible through a telescope before the outer reaches of the Solar System, where icy bodies and dwarf planets such as Pluto reside. Neptune is also one of the most distant objects visible to the naked eye.

      <h2>Quick Facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Orbital Distance:</strong> ~4.5 billion km (30.1 AU)</li>
        <li><strong>Orbital Period:</strong> 165 Earth years</li>
        <li><strong>Rotation Period:</strong> 16.11 hours</li>
        <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 49,244 km</li>
        <li><strong>Mass:</strong> 1.02 √ó 10¬≤‚Å∂ kg (17.2 times Earth's mass)</li>
        <li><strong>Gravity:</strong> 11.15 m/s¬≤</li>
        <li><strong>Average Temperature:</strong> -214¬∞C</li>
        <li><strong>Moons:</strong> 14 known moons (as of 2025)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Atmosphere & Weather</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune has a rich atmosphere composed mostly of hydrogen, helium, and methane. Its vibrant blue color is a result of methane, which absorbs red light and reflects blue. The weather on Neptune is extreme, with the fastest winds in the Solar System reaching up to 2,100 km/h. Neptune also experiences large storms, including the Great Dark Spot, which was observed by the Voyager 2 spacecraft. This storm is similar to Jupiter‚Äôs Great Red Spot, though it appears to be temporary, shifting locations and disappearing over time.
      </p>

      <h2>Moons</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune has 14 known moons, with the largest being Triton. Triton is unique because it orbits Neptune in the opposite direction to the planet‚Äôs rotation, suggesting that it was likely captured by Neptune's gravity rather than formed alongside it. Triton is also geologically active, with geysers spewing nitrogen gas and other materials from beneath its icy surface. Other notable moons of Neptune include Proteus, Nereid, and Larissa.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Triton:</strong> The largest moon of Neptune, Triton is unusual in that it has a retrograde orbit (opposite to Neptune‚Äôs rotation). It has a cold, icy surface with cryovolcanic activity, where nitrogen geysers erupt from beneath its frozen crust.</li>
        <li><strong>Proteus:</strong> Proteus is one of Neptune‚Äôs irregular moons. It has an irregular shape and is heavily cratered, with a dark surface.</li>
        <li><strong>Nereid:</strong> Nereid has a highly eccentric orbit around Neptune, ranging from close proximity to the planet to much greater distances. It is thought to be a captured object from the Kuiper Belt.</li>
        <li><strong>Larissa:</strong> Larissa is another irregular moon of Neptune. It is not as well-studied but is considered one of the planet‚Äôs smaller moons.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rings</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune has a faint system of rings, the most prominent of which are the Adams and Leverrier rings. These rings are dark and made up of small particles, with their composition still largely unknown. Unlike Saturn‚Äôs famous bright and large rings, Neptune‚Äôs rings are much harder to observe due to their faintness. Some of Neptune‚Äôs rings are thought to be much younger than the planet itself, suggesting that they may have been formed by collisions or the destruction of one of Neptune‚Äôs moons.
      </p>

      <h2>Structure & Composition</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune is composed mainly of water, ammonia, and methane, which are in the form of icy materials rather than gases, giving it the classification of an "ice giant." It has a rocky core surrounded by a thick atmosphere of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The outermost layers are composed of clouds of methane ice. As with Uranus, the planet has no solid surface, and the deeper you go into its interior, the temperature and pressure increase drastically.
      </p>

      <h2>Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        Neptune has been visited by only one spacecraft, NASA‚Äôs Voyager 2, which passed by the planet in 1989. During its flyby, Voyager 2 provided the first and only close-up images of Neptune and its moons. It discovered the planet‚Äôs Great Dark Spot, a storm similar to Jupiter‚Äôs Great Red Spot, and also observed Triton‚Äôs geysers. Since then, no other spacecraft has been sent specifically to explore Neptune, although there are plans for future missions to study its atmosphere, moons, and distant location in more detail.

      <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Neptune is the only planet in our Solar System that was discovered through mathematical predictions rather than direct observation.</li>
        <li>Despite being farther from the Sun than Uranus, Neptune is slightly warmer. This is likely due to its internal heat, as Neptune radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun.</li>
        <li>The winds on Neptune can reach speeds of over 2,100 km/h, which is faster than the speed of sound!</li>
        <li>Neptune‚Äôs moon Triton is the only large moon in the Solar System with a retrograde orbit, suggesting that it was captured by Neptune‚Äôs gravity.</li>
