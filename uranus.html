      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is often classified as an "ice giant." It has a distinctly unique tilt, rotating on its side compared to the other planets in the Solar System. Uranus was discovered in 1781 by Sir William Herschel, and it remains one of the least understood planets due to its extreme distance from Earth and its unusual characteristics. The planet's blue-green color is due to the methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light and reflects blue.

      <h2>Quick Facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Orbital Distance:</strong> ~2.87 billion km (19.2 AU)</li>
        <li><strong>Orbital Period:</strong> 84 Earth years</li>
        <li><strong>Rotation Period:</strong> 17.24 hours</li>
        <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 50,724 km</li>
        <li><strong>Mass:</strong> 8.68 √ó 10¬≤‚Å∂ kg (14.5 times Earth's mass)</li>
        <li><strong>Gravity:</strong> 8.69 m/s¬≤</li>
        <li><strong>Average Temperature:</strong> -224¬∞C</li>
        <li><strong>Moons:</strong> 27 known moons (as of 2025)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Atmosphere & Weather</h2>
      <p>
        Uranus' atmosphere is made up primarily of hydrogen, helium, and methane, along with trace amounts of water and ammonia. The planet‚Äôs extreme tilt gives it the most extreme seasons of any planet in the Solar System. Each pole gets about 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness. The weather on Uranus is frigid and inhospitable, with wind speeds reaching up to 900 km/h and temperatures that are colder than those on Neptune, despite being further from the Sun. The planet‚Äôs blue color is the result of methane, which absorbs red wavelengths of light and reflects blue.
      </p>

      <h2>Moons</h2>
      <p>
        Uranus has 27 known moons, with the five largest being Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. These moons are made mostly of ice and rock and show evidence of past geological activity. Some of Uranus‚Äô moons have mysterious surface features, such as large canyons and grooves, which suggest that they may have been active in the distant past.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Miranda:</strong> The smallest of Uranus‚Äô major moons, Miranda has a bizarre surface filled with ridges, valleys, and a large canyon system. Its unique appearance suggests it has undergone some kind of violent geological activity in the past.</li>
        <li><strong>Ariel:</strong> Ariel has one of the brightest and most geologically active surfaces in the Solar System. It features large canyons and ridges, with some signs of past volcanic activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Umbriel:</strong> The darkest of the large moons, Umbriel has a heavily cratered surface with little geological activity. It is thought to be the oldest of the major moons of Uranus.</li>
        <li><strong>Titania:</strong> Titania is the largest of Uranus‚Äô moons, with a surface marked by canyons and craters. It is thought to have once experienced tectonic activity, and some scientists believe it may have a subsurface ocean.</li>
        <li><strong>Oberon:</strong> Oberon has a heavily cratered surface and is the second-largest moon of Uranus. It is believed to be composed mostly of ice and rock, and it has some of the oldest surfaces in the Solar System.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rings</h2>
      <p>
        Uranus has 13 known rings, though they are not as extensive as Saturn‚Äôs. The rings are dark and composed of small particles, mainly ice and dust. They are thought to have been formed from debris from past moons or comets that were shattered by Uranus' gravity. Uranus‚Äô rings are unique in that they are tilted with respect to the planet‚Äôs equator, possibly as a result of the planet‚Äôs extreme axial tilt.
      </p>

      <h2>Structure & Composition</h2>
      <p>
        Uranus is classified as an ice giant because it contains more ice, such as water, ammonia, and methane, than Jupiter or Saturn, which are gas giants. The planet has a dense, icy core surrounded by a deep layer of liquid hydrogen and helium. The uppermost layer of the atmosphere is made up of gaseous hydrogen, helium, and methane. Below the cloud layer, temperatures rise, and the pressure increases as you descend towards the planet's icy mantle.
      </p>

      <h2>Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        Uranus has only been visited once by a spacecraft: NASA‚Äôs Voyager 2, which passed by the planet in 1986. During its flyby, Voyager 2 provided the first and only close-up images of the planet and its moons. The data it collected revealed Uranus‚Äô mysterious tilt, its faint ring system, and its strange magnetic field. However, due to the planet's distance from Earth, there have been no missions specifically designed to study Uranus in detail since then.

      <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Uranus has the coldest atmosphere of any planet in the Solar System, even colder than Neptune, despite being farther from the Sun!</li>
        <li>Uranus' extreme tilt means that it has the most unusual seasons. One pole faces the Sun for 42 years, while the other is in complete darkness.</li>
        <li>The rings of Uranus are dark and difficult to see, unlike the bright and reflective rings of Saturn.</li>
        <li>Uranus has a magnetic field that is tilted 59 degrees from the planet's rotational axis, making it one of the most extreme magnetic fields in the Solar System.</li>
